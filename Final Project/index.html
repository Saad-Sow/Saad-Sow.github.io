      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Saad Sow. I'm deeply interested in STEM and have been exploring different areas through both school and external programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did the STEM Inventory Lab Program at The Cooper Union’s Albert Nerken School of Engineering — a 14-week course where I earned certifications in Mechanics & Electronics, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning & AI. This experience gave me a brief exposure on how tech works and I want to learn more about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also interned at Beam Center, contributing to a team project designing a system to provide food and resources for a fictional island. This taught me about creative problem-solving, teamwork, and professional communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a First Tech Fund Fellow, I participated in regular workshops on public speaking, resume building, financial literacy, and more. I also worked closely with a mentor who supported me in setting goals and planning for life after high school.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of academics and internships, I volunteer at Room to Grow Daycare, helping manage inventory and maintain supply quality. I’m fluent in English, French, and Fulani, which allows me to connect with diverse communities in meaningful ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I’m seeking new opportunities in STEM where I can continue learning, meet new people, and grow both personally and professionally.

            I am deeply interested in technology because the world today revolves around it, with everything becoming digitalized. What excites me the most is learning about cybersecurity, especially how some people can infiltrate servers despite firewalls and high levels of security. I’ve had a chance to get a brief exposure to coding through the STEM lab program at Cooper Union, which sparked my curiosity even more. Additionally, I completed a six-week intensive course on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript at The Knowledge House through KKCF, which helped me build a strong foundation in web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, I have a strong belief in the importance of sales. I see sales as an essential skill in every aspect of life—whether you’re selling yourself, a product, or a service. It’s about communication, persuasion, and building trust with others. The ability to sell effectively means you can share your ideas clearly, influence decisions, and create meaningful connections. Sales drives progress and growth, and understanding how to do it well can open many doors. I am fascinated by how sales techniques can be combined with technology to improve customer experiences and business strategies. This combination of tech and sales is something I’m passionate about exploring further, as I believe it holds the key to innovation and success in today’s digital world.
